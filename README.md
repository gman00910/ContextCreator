# ContextCreator
A wrapper tool with a UI that gathers repository context for AI coding development.

Create your own custom config.yaml file for flexibility with ANY project. Start with defining your repository 
and make groups for certain "paths" that you may want to pull the scripts all together for a complete context package, 
for example, the database structure.

It has many built in mini features such as logging detection, dynamic file searching, architecture tree print, and a nice
terminal flow that will you the context you need all in a single output .txt!

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Docker & Docker Compose
- TimescaleDB
- Redis (optional, for caching)


### Quick Start
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/algobot.git
cd algobot

# Set up environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
# or
.\venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Launch infrastructure
docker-compose up -d

# Initialize database
python manage.py init

# Start development server
python src/main.py --env development --debug
```


### Environment Configuration
```bash
# Development
docker-compose -f docker-compose.base.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
# Production
docker-compose -f docker-compose.base.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```


## 📊 Example Strategy
```python
from algobot.strategies import BaseStrategy
from algobot.indicators import SMA, RSI

class MomentumStrategy(BaseStrategy):
    def __init__(self, config: dict):
        super().__init__(config)
        self.sma = SMA(period=20)
        self.rsi = RSI(period=14)
    async def on_data(self, data: MarketData):
        signal = await self.analyze(data)
        if signal:
            await self.execute_trade(signal)
```


## 🛠️ Development

### Testing
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/ -v
# Run specific test suite
pytest tests/test_database.py -v
pytest tests/test_integration.py -v
```
